  This time, there are four apples, but they're all in the same place.

  I can only eat one apple a time when I move to a square with an apple.
  So, to eat them all, I have to move away, turn around and come back.

  Can you help me by writing a `function` that does exactly this?

        It seems you finished without implementing the `knightMove` function.

        To get three stars, make sure you've implemented this function.

        It seems your code is too long. You can do it in less lines of code!
