  So, a key is actually a variable. In the previous level, the key always had the
  value `true` (a Boolean value).

  In this level, the key will be some number. You don't know which number until
  you pick it up. It changes every time you restart the level.
  
  The lock can also be unlocked with a number. But! The number for unlocking the lock
  is not the same as the value of the key. You have to do something to the
  key before unlocking the lock.

  If you click on the lock, you will see what value the lock will accept given the
  value of the key. From this table, can you figure out what you have to do to the
  variable to unlock the lock?
