name: Variables
instructions: |-
  Let's try something new. A part of the code has already been
  written, and you have to help out to make it work.

  In the code, two *variables* are used: `stepsUp` and `stepsRight`. It's your job
  to declare (create) these variables.

  Read up on variables on [this MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables).

  *Tip:*

  - If you want to see *all* JavaScripts steps that are executed, not only the ones that move the robot,
    activate the VERBOSE switch at the top right of the screen.

        You have used `var` to declare your variables. Nowadays, we encourage programmers to use
        `let` or `const`.
        
        Do you know which of the two to use?

        Great, but think about whether you should use `let` or `const`. Are the values of your
        variables ever going to change after you've initialized them?
