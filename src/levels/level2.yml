  // Alright, that was easy. Now Rover has lost himself in an
  // apple orchard. Of course, you can type out `move()` seven
  // times, but the point of writing code is to not repeat
  // yourself too often.
  //
  // Can you find a way using a *for loop* to get Rover to the
  // flag in only three lines of code?
